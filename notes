These will be my notes from office hours and anything else important:

The data are actually aggregated averages. I need to look into regressing on aggregated data (weights, weighted least squares)

How to address outliers: 
Top coding is an option ie. everything over a certain number is just that number (everything over 100 is just 100)
You can also convert things to a percentile

Residuals:
Check residuals for this, should be normal or at least roughly normal, if not normal, top code

General Org:
Eliminate college tiers you don't need. This will make prediction more accurate (removing outliersand unnecessary data points)
